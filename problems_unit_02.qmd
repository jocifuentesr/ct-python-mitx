## Context

Each month, a credit card statement will come with the option for you to pay a minimum amount of your charge, usually 2% of the balance due. However, the credit card company earns money by charging interest on the balance that you don't pay. So even if you pay credit card payments on time, interest is still accruing on the outstanding balance.

Say you've made a \$5,000 purchase on a credit card with an 18% annual interest rate and a 2% minimum monthly payment rate. If you only pay the minimum monthly amount for a year, how much is the remaining balance?

You can think about this in the following way.

At the beginning of month 0 (when the credit card statement arrives), assume you owe an amount we will call $b_0$ (b for balance; subscript 0 to indicate this is the balance at month 0).

Any payment you make during that month is deducted from the balance. Let's call the payment you make in month 0, $p_0$. Thus, **your unpaid** balance for month 0, $ub_0$ , is equal to $b_0-p_0$.

$$ 
ub_0=b_0 - p_0 
$$

At the beginning of month 1, the credit card company will charge you interest on your unpaid balance. So if your annual interest rate is $r$ , then at the beginning of month 1, your new balance is your previous unpaid balance $ub_0$, **plus** the interest on this unpaid balance for the month. In algebra, this new balance would be

$$
b_1 = ub_0 + \frac{r}{12.0} \cdot ub_0
$$

In month 1, we will make another payment, $p1$. That payment has to cover some of the interest costs, so it does not completely go towards paying off the original charge. The balance at the beginning of month 2, $b_2$ , can be calculated by first calculating the unpaid balance after paying $$p1, then by adding the interest accrued:

$$
ub_1 = b_1 - p_1
$$

$$
b_2 = ub_1 + \frac{r}{12.0} \cdot ub_1
$$

If you choose just to pay off the minimum monthly payment each month, you will see that the compound interest will dramatically reduce your ability to lower your debt.

Let's look at an example. If you've got a $5,000 balance on a credit card with 18% annual interest rate, and the minimum monthly payment is 2% of the current balance, we would have the following repayment schedule if you only pay the minimum payment each month:

| Month | Balance          | Minimum Payment            | Unpaid Balance               | Interest                     |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0     | $5000.00         | $100 (= $5000 * 0.02)      | $4900 (= $5000 - $100)       | $73.50 (= 0.18/12.0 * $4900) |
| 1     | $4973.50 (= $4900 + $73.50) | $99.47 (= $4973.50 * 0.02) | $4874.03 (= $4973.50 - $99.47) | $73.11 (= 0.18/12.0 * $4874.03) |
| 2     | $4947.14 (= $4874.03 + $73.11) | $98.94 (= $4947.14 * 0.02) | $4848.20 (= $4947.14 - $98.94) | $72.72 (= 0.18/12.0 * $4848.20) |

## Problem 1 - Paying Debt off in a Year
Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

The following variables contain values as described below:

1. **balance** - the outstanding balance on the credit card
2. **annualInterestRate** - annual interest rate as a decimal
3. **monthlyPaymentRate** - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance. At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance. Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy - so print

```
Remaining balance: 813.41
```
instead of

```
Remaining balance: 813.4141998135 
```
So your program only prints out one thing: the remaining balance at the end of the year in the format:
```
Remaining balance: 4784.0
```

A summary of the required math is found below:

- **Monthly interest rate** = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
- **Minimum monthly payment** = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)
- **Monthly unpaid balance** = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)
- **Updated balance each month** = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)

**Test cases: **

Test Case 1:
	      
          balance = 42
	      annualInterestRate = 0.2
	      monthlyPaymentRate = 0.04

          # To make sure you are doing calculation correctly, this is the 
          # remaining balance you should be getting at each month for this example

## Hints
**Only two decimal digits of accuracy?**

Use the round function at the end of your code!

**How to think about this problem?**
To help you get started, here is a rough outline of the stages you should probably follow in writing your code:

- For each month:
  - Compute the monthly payment, based on the previous monthâ€™s balance.
  - Update the outstanding balance by removing the payment, then charging interest on the result.
  - Output the month, the minimum monthly payment and the remaining balance.
  - Keep track of the total amount of paid over all the past months so far.
- Print out the result statement with the total amount paid and the remaining balance.

Use these ideas to guide the creation of your code.

- If you're unfamiliar with how our autograder works, first try out one of the infinite check problems in the Functions lecture sequence.
- Please be judicious with your checks, as we are unable to give you more than 30 checks. However this should be more than sufficient: if you do your code development in your local environment, and ensure you can pass our test cases, you should not require more than a few checks once you paste your working, tested code into our code box.

- "Staff Debug: L397 Error" means your code has an infinite loop...

**Clicking Check may give you the error:**

- There was a problem running your solution (Staff debug: L379). We couldn't run your solution (Staff debug: L397)..
- This means your code is taking too long or has an infinite loop. Test your code with more unique test cases, such as very large or very small values.

**Do not define your own values**

- For problems such as these, do not include input statements or define variables we told you would be given. Our automated testing will provide values for you - so write your code in the following box assuming those variables are already defined. The code you paste into the following box should not specify the values for the variables balance, annualInterestRate, or monthlyPaymentRate
